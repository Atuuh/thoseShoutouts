## Customisation

Open up **config.js** and inside you can change the following variables:

- pauseDuration - the length of time the shoutout will pause in the centre of the screen (in milliseconds)
- rollInOutDuration - time taken for the image and text to roll in to the centre of the screen (in milliseconds)
- userBackgroundColour - background color of the label
- userTextColour - text color of the label

## Limitations
Currently this code has the following shortcomings:

- Support only for 1920px by 350px sized source
- Fixed size animation
- Only one type of animation (roll in and out)
- Manual steps to setup config.js for authorisation

## Depenencies
This code makes use of the following libraries

- [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js)
- [anime.js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime)
