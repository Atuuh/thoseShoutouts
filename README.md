# Animated Shoutouts by [thoseEyes](https://twitch.tv/thoseeyes) 
A simple animation that responds to the !so command in Twitch chat. It shows a streamers profile image and username.

To get started, download the the code [here](https://github.com/thoseEyes/thoseShoutouts/archive/main.zip) and double-click 'starthere.htm' for full instructions on how to set this up.

Currently this code has the following shortcomings:

- Support only for 1920px by 350px sized source
- Fixed size animation
- Only one type of animation (roll in and out)
- Manual steps to setup config.js for authorisation

This code makes use of the following libraries

- [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js)
- [anime.js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime)
